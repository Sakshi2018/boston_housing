# boston_housing
This is my project from the Machine Learning Nano Degree from Udacity  in which I need to predict the selling house prices from a
popular dataset called the Boston housing data. 
This project covers exploring the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. 
It also includes splitting the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. 
Then, performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes has been analyzed which helps
to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. 
At the end, this optimal model has been tested on a new sample and comparison has been done for the predicted selling price with the 
statistics obtained.

Things I have learnt by completing this project:

- How to use NumPy to investigate the latent features of a dataset.
- How to analyze various learning performance plots for variance and bias.
- How to determine the best-guess model for predictions from unseen data.
- How to evaluate a model's performance on unseen data using previous data.

## Description
The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, you\'ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for your clients\' homes.

This project contains four files:

- `boston_housing.ipynb`: This is the main file where I have worked on the project.
- `housing.csv`: The project dataset. 
- `visuals.py`: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.
- `report.html`: Final submission file
