# boston_housing
This is my project from the Machine Learning Nano Degree from Udacity  in which I need to predict the selling house prices from a
popular dataset called the Boston housing data. 
This project covers exploring the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. 
It also includes splitting the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. 
Then, performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes has been analyzed which helps
to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. 
At the end, this optimal model has been tested on a new sample and comparison has been done for the predicted selling price with the 
statistics obtained.
